Basic learning ticketing system that runs several workflows:

1. Opens new tickets with learning ideas or objectives in them.
2. Updates the status of open tickets when prompted.
3. Edits open tickets as they may change or develop.
4. Closes tickets when completed or deleted, and moves to archive.
5. Reopens archived tickets.

The backend will be an Excel spreadsheet than can be read and written to. Should this be moved to an array at some stage?

The frontend will for now be a simply Python script that provides the various work flow options. This could be extended into a neater user interface over time.
